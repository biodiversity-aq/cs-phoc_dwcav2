The U.S. AMLR Program resumed these surveys in 2009/10, and, except for 2020/21 when the field season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, have continued surveys every season since through the time of publication. Most CS-PHOC survey windows (i.e., censuses) were only one day, meaning surveys of all locations were conducted on the same day. However, censuses occasionally spanned two or three days due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., weather). The INACH and U.S. AMLR programs both followed the same overall census protocol, where trained field biologists surveyed safely accessible regions of Cape Shirreff and recorded all live phocids. Biologists used field notebooks to record counts of each phocid species at each location, along with age class and sex when possible. Phocids were only recorded if they were hauled out on land, and not if they were for instance on an ice flow or swimming just offshore. After the survey, data were entered into a database or otherwise archived. Locations were surveyed on foot, by either walking through haul-out locations or using binoculars from a high vantage point where practical. While the full extent of the area surveyed varied slightly both across and within seasons, core census locations were always surveyed. These core census locations span the vast majority of phocid haul-out locations at Cape Shirreff, thereby ensuring that CS-PHOC data are both consistent and representative of phocid haul-out at Cape Shirreff across all censuses and seasons.
