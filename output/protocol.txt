185-1	CS-PHOC-Census	Survey	Census	census protocol	Trained field biologists surveyed safely accessible regions of Cape Shirreff and recorded all live phocids. Biologists used field notebooks to record counts of each phocid species at each location, along with age class and sex when possible. Phocids were only recorded if they were hauled out on land, and not if they were for instance on an ice flow or swimming just offshore. After the survey, data were entered into a database or otherwise archived. Locations were surveyed on foot, by either walking through haul-out locations or using binoculars from a high vantage point where practical. While the full extent of the area surveyed varied slightly both across and within seasons, core census locations were always surveyed. These core census locations span the vast majority of phocid haul-out locations at Cape Shirreff, thereby ensuring that CS-PHOC data are both consistent and representative of phocid haul-out at Cape Shirreff across all censuses and seasons.

236-1	CS-PHOC-Census	Survey	Census	census protocol	Trained field biologists surveyed safely accessible regions of Cape Shirreff and recorded all live phocids. Biologists used field notebooks to record counts of each phocid species at each location, along with age class and sex when possible. Phocids were only recorded if they were hauled out on land, and not if they were for instance on an ice flow or swimming just offshore. After the survey, data were entered into a database or otherwise archived. Locations were surveyed on foot, by either walking through haul-out locations or using binoculars from a high vantage point where practical.

261-1	CS-PHOC-Census	Survey	Census	census protocol	Trained field biologists surveyed safely accessible regions of Cape Shirreff and recorded all live phocids. Biologists used field notebooks to record counts of each phocid species at each location, along with age class and sex when possible. Phocids were only recorded if they were hauled out on land, and not if they were for instance on an ice flow or swimming just offshore. After the survey, data were entered into a database or otherwise archived. Locations were surveyed on foot, by either walking through haul-out locations or using binoculars from a high vantage point where practical. While the full extent of the area surveyed varied slightly both across and within seasons, core census locations were always surveyed.

149-2	CS-PHOC-Census	Survey	Census	census protocol	Trained field biologists surveyed safely accessible regions of Cape Shirreff and recorded all live phocids. Biologists used field notebooks to record counts of each phocid species at each location, along with age class and sex when possible. Phocids were only recorded if they were hauled out on land, and not if they were for instance on an ice flow or swimming just offshore. After the survey, data were entered into a database or otherwise archived. Locations were surveyed on foot, by either walking through haul-out locations or using binoculars from a high vantage point where practical. While the full extent of the area surveyed varied slightly both across and within seasons, core census locations were always surveyed. These core census locations span the vast majority of phocid haul-out locations at Cape Shirreff, thereby ensuring that CS-PHOC data are both consistent and representative of phocid haul-out at Cape Shirreff across all censuses and seasons.

Biologists used field notebooks to record counts of each phocid species at each location, along with age class and sex when possible. Phocids were only recorded if they were hauled out on land, and not if they were for instance on an ice flow or swimming just offshore. After the survey, data were entered into a database or otherwise archived. Locations were surveyed on foot, by either walking through haul-out locations or using binoculars from a high vantage point where practical. While the full extent of the area surveyed varied slightly both across and within seasons, core census locations were always surveyed. These core census locations span the vast majority of phocid haul-out locations at Cape Shirreff, thereby ensuring that CS-PHOC data are both consistent and representative of phocid haul-out at Cape Shirreff across all censuses and seasons.

16-1	CS-PHOC-Census	Survey	Census	census protocol	Trained field biologists surveyed safely accessible regions of Cape Shirreff and recorded all live phocids. Biologists used field notebooks to record counts of each phocid species at each location, along with age class and sex when possible. Phocids were only recorded if they were hauled out on land, and not if they were for instance on an ice flow or swimming just offshore. After the survey, data were entered into a database or otherwise archived. Locations were surveyed on foot, by either walking through haul-out locations or using binoculars from a high vantage point where practical. While the full extent of the area surveyed varied slightly both across and within seasons, core census locations were always surveyed.

28-2	CS-PHOC-Census	Survey	Census	census protocol	Trained field biologists surveyed safely accessible regions of Cape Shirreff and recorded all live phocids. Biologists used field notebooks to record counts of each phocid species at each location, along with age class and sex when possible. Phocids were only recorded if they were hauled out on land, and not if they were for instance on an ice flow or swimming just offshore. After the survey, data were entered into a database or otherwise archived. Locations were surveyed on foot, by either walking through haul-out locations or using binoculars from a high vantage point where practical. While the full extent of the area surveyed varied slightly both across and within seasons, core census locations were always surveyed. These core census locations span the vast majority of phocid haul-out locations at Cape Shirreff, thereby ensuring that CS-PHOC data are both consistent and representative of phocid haul-out at Cape Shirreff across all censuses and seasons.

Phocids were only recorded if they were hauled out on land, and not if they were for instance on an ice flow or swimming just offshore. After the survey, data were entered into a database or otherwise archived. Locations were surveyed on foot, by either walking through haul-out locations or using binoculars from a high vantage point where practical. While the full extent of the area surveyed varied slightly both across and within seasons, core census locations were always surveyed. These core census locations span the vast majority of phocid haul-out locations at Cape Shirreff, thereby ensuring that CS-PHOC data are both consistent and representative of phocid haul-out at Cape Shirreff across all censuses and seasons.

66-2	CS-PHOC-Census	Survey	Census	census protocol	Trained field biologists surveyed safely accessible regions of Cape Shirreff and recorded all live phocids. Biologists used field notebooks to record counts of each phocid species at each location, along with age class and sex when possible. Phocids were only recorded if they were hauled out on land, and not if they were for instance on an ice flow or swimming just offshore. After the survey, data were entered into a database or otherwise archived. Locations were surveyed on foot, by either walking through haul-out locations or using binoculars from a high vantage point where practical. While the full extent of the area surveyed varied slightly both across and within seasons, core census locations were always surveyed.

79-1	CS-PHOC-Census	Survey	Census	census protocol	Trained field biologists surveyed safely accessible regions of Cape Shirreff and recorded all live phocids. Biologists used field notebooks to record counts of each phocid species at each location, along with age class and sex when possible. Phocids were only recorded if they were hauled out on land, and not if they were for instance on an ice flow or swimming just offshore. After the survey, data were entered into a database or otherwise archived. Locations were surveyed on foot, by either walking through haul-out locations or using binoculars from a high vantage point where practical. While the full extent of the area surveyed varied slightly both across and within seasons, core census locations were always surveyed. These core census locations span the vast majority of phocid haul-out locations at Cape Shirreff, thereby ensuring that CS-PHOC data are both consistent and representative of phocid haul-out at Cape Shirreff across all censuses and seasons.

Phocids were only recorded if they were hauled out on land, and not if they were for instance on an ice flow or swimming just offshore. After the survey, data were entered into a database or otherwise archived. Locations were surveyed on foot, by either walking through haul-out locations or using binoculars from a high vantage point where practical. While the full extent of the area surveyed varied slightly both across and within seasons, core census locations were always surveyed. These core census locations span the vast majority of phocid haul-out locations at Cape Shirreff, thereby ensuring that CS-PHOC data are both consistent and representative of phocid haul-out at Cape Shirreff across all censuses and seasons.

117-1	CS-PHOC-Census	Survey	Census	census protocol	Trained field biologists surveyed safely accessible regions of Cape Shirreff and recorded all live phocids. Biologists used field notebooks to record counts of each phocid species at each location, along with age class and sex when possible. Phocids were only recorded if they were hauled out on land, and not if they were for instance on an ice flow or swimming just offshore. After the survey, data were entered into a database or otherwise archived. Locations were surveyed on foot, by either walking through haul-out locations or using binoculars from a high vantage point where practical. While the full extent of the area surveyed varied slightly both across and within seasons, core census locations were always surveyed.

130-1	CS-PHOC-Census	Survey	Census	census protocol	Trained field biologists surveyed safely accessible regions of Cape Shirreff and recorded all live phocids. Biologists used field notebooks to record counts of each phocid species at each location, along with age class and sex when possible. Phocids were only recorded if they were hauled out on land, and not if they were for instance on an ice flow or swimming just offshore. After the survey, data were entered into a database or otherwise archived. Locations were surveyed on foot, by either walking through haul-out locations or using binoculars from a high vantage point where practical. While the full extent of the area surveyed varied slightly both across and within seasons, core census locations were always surveyed. These core census locations span the vast majority of phocid haul-out locations at Cape Shirreff, thereby ensuring that CS-PHOC data are both consistent and representative of phocid haul-out at Cape Shirreff across all censuses and seasons.

Biologists used field notebooks to record counts of each phocid species at each location, along with age class and sex when possible. Phocids were only recorded if they were hauled out on land, and not if they were for instance on an ice flow or swimming just offshore. After the survey, data were entered into a database or otherwise archived. Locations were surveyed on foot, by either walking through haul-out locations or using binoculars from a high vantage point where practical. While the full extent of the area surveyed varied slightly both across and within seasons, core census locations were always surveyed. These core census locations span the vast majority of phocid haul-out locations at Cape Shirreff, thereby ensuring that CS-PHOC data are both consistent and representative of phocid haul-out at Cape Shirreff across all censuses and seasons.

After the survey, data were entered into a database or otherwise archived. Locations were surveyed on foot, by either walking through haul-out locations or using binoculars from a high vantage point where practical. While the full extent of the area surveyed varied slightly both across and within seasons, core census locations were always surveyed. These core census locations span the vast majority of phocid haul-out locations at Cape Shirreff, thereby ensuring that CS-PHOC data are both consistent and representative of phocid haul-out at Cape Shirreff across all censuses and seasons.

185-1	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species. These aggregated core census location counts, along with counts for one other location (Punta San Telmo, described in “Data Records” in the publication), make up the published CS-PHOC dataset.

199-1	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species.

215-1	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species.

231-1	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species.

247-1	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species.

263-1	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species.

279-1	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species. These aggregated core census location counts, along with counts for one other location (Punta San Telmo, described in “Data Records” in the publication), make up the published CS-PHOC dataset.

154-1	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species.

162-1	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species. These aggregated core census location counts, along with counts for one other location (Punta San Telmo, described in “Data Records” in the publication), make up the published CS-PHOC dataset.

170-1	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species.

5-2	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species. These aggregated core census location counts, along with counts for one other location (Punta San Telmo, described in “Data Records” in the publication), make up the published CS-PHOC dataset.

14-2	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species.

22-2	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species.

30-2	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species.

38-2	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species.

46-2	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species. These aggregated core census location counts, along with counts for one other location (Punta San Telmo, described in “Data Records” in the publication), make up the published CS-PHOC dataset.

54-2	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species.

62-2	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species.

70-2	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species.

78-2	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species. These aggregated core census location counts, along with counts for one other location (Punta San Telmo, described in “Data Records” in the publication), make up the published CS-PHOC dataset.

86-2	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species. These aggregated core census location counts, along with counts for one other location (Punta San Telmo, described in “Data Records” in the publication), make up the published CS-PHOC dataset.

94-2	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species. These aggregated core census location counts, along with counts for one other location (Punta San Telmo, described in “Data Records” in the publication), make up the published CS-PHOC dataset.

102-2	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species. These aggregated core census location counts, along with counts for one other location (Punta San Telmo, described in “Data Records” in the publication), make up the published CS-PHOC dataset.

110-2	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species. These aggregated core census location counts, along with counts for one other location (Punta San Telmo, described in “Data Records” in the publication), make up the published CS-PHOC dataset.

118-2	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species. These aggregated core census location counts, along with counts for one other location (Punta San Telmo, described in “Data Records” in the publication), make up the published CS-PHOC dataset.

127-1	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species.

135-2	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species. These aggregated core census location counts, along with counts for one other location (Punta San Telmo, described in “Data Records” in the publication), make up the published CS-PHOC dataset.

143-2	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species. These aggregated core census location counts, along with counts for one other location (Punta San Telmo, described in “Data Records” in the publication), make up the published CS-PHOC dataset.

177-2	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species. These aggregated core census location counts, along with counts for one other location (Punta San Telmo, described in “Data Records” in the publication), make up the published CS-PHOC dataset.

285-2	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species. These aggregated core census location counts, along with counts for one other location (Punta San Telmo, described in “Data Records” in the publication), make up the published CS-PHOC dataset.

1293-2	CS-PHOC-Data	Survey	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data cleaning and aggregation	Data records were compiled from historical documents, field notebooks, Excel files, and a SQL Server database. INACH historical data (i.e., paper records, reports, and Excel files) were consolidated into Excel files. These INACH files, along with historical U.S. AMLR Excel files, were imported into the U.S. AMLR Pinniped SQL Server database using R (v4.3). Once in the database, all data were read into R, where they were cleaned and standardized as follows. Location names and count types (i.e., age class and sex) were converted to standard names, and columns containing count data were aggregated to the lowest resolution across datasets. For instance, some seasons male and female pup counts were recorded separately, but during others only a single count of all pups was recorded. Thus, for this dataset, all pup counts were aggregated to a single, total pup count for each survey record. In addition, recorded data varied slightly across programs. Specifically, data from INACH surveys included explicit zero records when there were none of a particular phocid species at a location, while data from U.S. AMLR surveys only included non-zero counts. To make these data consistent, U.S. AMLR data were made explicit by adding zero records as necessary. After data cleaning and standardization, records from the core census locations were grouped and aggregated to provide a single, comparable count for each species for each census. Specifically, records were filtered for core census locations, and counts were summed after grouping by census and species. These aggregated core census location counts, along with counts for one other location (Punta San Telmo, described in “Data Records” in the publication), make up the published CS-PHOC dataset.
